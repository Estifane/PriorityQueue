# PriorityQueue
Introduction 
- This Java Application demonstrates the use of a min-heap  data format for task prioritization and management. Users can examine the highest-priority task, remove the highest-priority work, and add tasks with corresponding urgency levels (shown as integers, where lower is more urgent).
What it can do
- Add task: The enables users to provide an integer representing the task's urgency level and description. The min-heap is then updated with the task.
- View Highest Priority Task: Shows the job in the heap that has the highest priority (lowest urgency level) without deleting it.
- Remove Highest Priority Task: Takes the task with the highest priority out of the heap and shows it.
- Exit: Puts an end to the application.
Why this Application?
- This Application demonstrates the real-world use of a min-heap data structure, a key idea in computer science. Min-heaps are perfect for situations like task prioritizing, event scheduling, and priority queues when it's necessary to efficiently get the smallest member. I was able to strengthen my grasp of heap data structures and how Java implements them by creating this program. Additionally, it illustrates a straightforward but practical usage of this data structure that might be readily expanded for more intricate task management situations.
